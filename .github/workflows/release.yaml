      - name: Manual Review and Upload (Recommended)
        # **Important:** Emphasize manual review for safety and adherence to platform guidelines.
        #   - This step doesn't have a `uses` or `run` key as it's a manual process.
        #   - Users should manually review the generated assets (including .vsix) and upload them
        #     to the extension publishing platform following their guidelines.
        #     This ensures compliance and avoids potential issues.
